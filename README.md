# graph_weights
A working example of an Autogen groupchat with pseudo weights and biases implemented using Description and JSON mode

"weights" are created by getting the Agent conform to a JSON strucutre that includes calculable values (typically just a rating from 1 - 10) alongside any general textual response.

eg: 

"query": "<original message goes here>",  # copy the original user request, without edit, into this field.
                                    "query_emotions": { # analyse the user message and determine the three strongest emotions present, and give eachof them a rating of strength from 1 -10. 
                                        "emotion_1":" strength rating 1-10",
                                        "emotion_2":" strength rating 1-10",
                                        "emotion_3":" strength rating 1-10",
                                    }


"Biases", or how we determine which node is activated, is enabled by introducing some basic maths intho the Agent Descritpion. 

eg: 
description = """Call this agent In the following scenarios:
                    1. the userquery's coersive_rating is greater than 6 and friendliness rating is less than 3
                    2. the userquery's trust_rating is less than 3
    """

When The Chat_Manager reads the description of all the neighbouring Nodes when choosing next speaker, they will assess the weights pressent in the message and choose the Node (Agent) that fulfils these. 


This example is a very small set of nodes focused on Cogsec, and preventing Agent manipulation, but obviously the principles here can be applied in many ways.

Example output:
